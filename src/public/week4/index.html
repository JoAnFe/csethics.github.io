<p><strong>Team 1</strong></p>
<h3 id="23-february">23 February</h3>
<p>Tuesday’s class focused on the concept of technology “benevolence” —
a double edged sword due to the difference between intentions and
technological exploits. There was a focus on how technology
dehumanizes and how institutions use buzzwords to create an open and
inclusive imagery while still participating in discriminatory
practices. With this introduction, we entered a series of discussions
revolving around several case studies of such technological pitfalls:</p>
<h4 id="gps-surveillance">GPS Surveillance</h4>
<p>The first discussion (<em>24 hour surveillance with ankle monitors:
dehumanization or supervision?</em>) centered on ankle monitors used for
24 hour remote surveillance to monitor offenders. This allows for the
freeing up of beds in jails and is used for those who cannot afford
bail. Inherently, the use of these monitors results in privilege of
the rich while targeting those in lower income communities.  This
discussion started with agreement that using ankle monitors during
pre-trial is a better alternative than the alternative of keeping
people in jail. We also came to agreement that the technology used
isn’t really the issue, but the cash bail system as a whole. We then
pivoted to a related discussion on COVID tracking. We found that COVID
tracking by location was similar in its dehumanization of
participants, but it was fairer in how it was applied equally across
classes and races.</p>
<h4 id="automated-resume-scanner">Automated Resume Scanner</h4>
<p>Next, we moved into a discussion about <em>automated resume scanners</em>. In
today’s age, many companies are using AI to parse resume
qualifications due to the large number of applicants and ease of
checking for qualifications. However, issues have arisen as a
result. For example, Amazon (Oct. 2018) was found to have
discriminated against women in the hiring process – terms such as
“Women’s Chess Club” or “Women’s Cybersecurity” were not being taken
into consideration when the algorithm was told to ignore biases on the
account of gender. Discussion focused on whether students would use
the resume scanner to their advantage and whether doing so was
ethical. Similar points were made regarding the current practice of
buzzword formatting to resumes with respect to skills such as machine
learning and programming languages (C++, Python, Java, etc.) that
recruiters look for. Therefore, in the competitive job market, there
is a need to use appropriate action words and terminology to catch the
eyes of the recruiter or the resume parser. However, the usage of
“invisible ink” (hidden words) in a resume is deemed unethical and
unprofessional since it&rsquo;s more apparent as an intention of lying to
the machine and employer.</p>
<h4 id="predicting-race">Predicting Race</h4>
<p>This was followed with another discussion: <em>Collection of
racial-ethnic data: diversity or technological redlining</em>? We focused
on the company Diversity Inc. that was brought up in Benjamin’s
writing. Diversity Inc. creates racial-ethnic data that can be sold to
others; the usage of such a service results in effective
discrimination and group inclusivity. Provided a name, the company can
produce a racial-ethnic profile for customers. Since many companies
are not allowed to collect ethno-racial data directly, this service is
a game changer for the Diversity Inc’s customers.</p>
<p>In discussion, people debated whether race was more private compared
to other personal data that is normally collected. Most people agreed
that race isn’t something that they hold private because it is clearly
displayed in public. However, predicting people&rsquo;s race, especially
when they don’t want to disclose it (such as in job hiring or
housing), does cause issues. We also discussed that predicting
people’s race to tailor personalized results or advertising isn’t
creating as personal of an experience that these companies
believe. Large differences exist within every race to the point where
we believe that targeting people based on their race is a pointless
effort.</p>
<h4 id="predictive-health-monitoring">Predictive Health Monitoring</h4>
<p>The final discussion (Predictive health monitoring: cultural
segregation or inclusion?) was about the use of zip codes to predict
health outcomes. There are many ways to get around HIPAA and one of
them is the use of zip codes to determine which neighborhoods would
cost the most in healthcare. Diversity Inc.’s triangulation of
information via name and zip code can similarly be used to identify
consumer habits, an extremely profitable service; however, this leads
to cultural segregation. In the discussion of this topic, many groups
talked about various applications of predictive health monitoring and
how it impacts marginalized areas of society. One application of this
technology was risk assessment for health insurance. While many
insurance companies argue that the “objective” nature of their risk
evaluations foster diversity and inclusion, they fail to realize that,
even though race is not explicitly considered as a factor, there are
still many other factors such as zip code that can be used to predict
one’s ethnicity (and develop biases as a result). Therefore, while the
intent behind many of these predictive algorithms may be sincere, it
is vital to consider all of the possible ways that discrimination can
arise and take the appropriate measures to mitigate them.</p>
<h4 id="machine-learning">Machine Learning</h4>
<p>The second part of Tuesday’s class focused on a brief overview of
machine learning to better understand the optional readings for the
week. Basic understanding of deep learning — supervised
vs. unsupervised learning, general neural network models (CNN),
limitations in accuracy (high variance via overfitting and bias from
bad data resulting in underfitting) — was required to better dig into
the concept of LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations),
an interpretable model to explain predictions of classifiers. The
major takeaway from the machine learning mini lecture was that
accuracy is not a metric of whether a model was good or not, a concept
referred to as the accuracy paradox. We ended the class with a
discussion of the what issues that can be anticipated with the use of
an explanatory model (with reference to LIME) to explain a black box
model.</p>
<p>Students brought up many concerns with this method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Isolation of problem but little traceback to solution discovery</li>
<li>More of a “black box” due to little explanation of what happens “under the hood”</li>
<li>Promotion of over-reliance on technology</li>
<li>No guarantee of accuracy and/or precision (may not work with more complicated models)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="25-february">25 FEbruary</h2>
<p>Thursday’s class opened with a small group discussion on the
brainstorm prompt posed at the end of Tuesday’s class: <em>What does
design justice look like and how can it be achieved?</em></p>
<p>Notably, it was emphasized that at the bare minimum, more
comprehensive testing needs to be implemented. Group members asserted
that technology’s performance should be assessed across marginalized
and non-marginalized groups. Then, disparities in performance should
be corrected and/or acknowledged. Another point emphasized that
training data should be more critically assessed. To have design
justice, good training data must be used. Additionally, class members
noted that disability should be centered in design to ensure equitable
access. One member stated that true design justice is achieved by
centering marginalized groups from the beginning of the design
process. Finally, one member referred the class to a resource found at
the back of Benjamin’s book (<a href="https://designjustice.org">https://designjustice.org</a>.</p>
<h4 id="promise">Promise</h4>
<p>The next discussion centered on the Promise App and pre-trial
bail. The class member presenting touched on how inundated Virginia’s
jails are with citizens awaiting trial. She noted the way that bail is
determined in a closed-door setting by a magistrate, with no lawyers
present. This immense pressure often causes the detained to plead
guilty. She then presented the concept of the Promise app, which
provides a variety of services including: helping criminalized people
pay bail, tracking individuals on the app, helping schedule
plans/appointments, and tracking if people have kept these
appointments. She noted that donations are recycled when bail is
returned. Additionally, she described how external government agencies
have access to an individual’s user data.</p>
<p>The discussion questions posed to the class were:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What are your general thoughts and opinions of the Promise app?</em></li>
<li><em>Is it morally just to have this information available to government agencies?</em></li>
<li><em>How do you think that his app interacts with Benjamin’s quote: “Calls for
abolition are never simply about bringing harmful systems to an end
but also about envisioning new ones”?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In response to these questions, class members brought up how more data
from apps such as Promise enable tech companies to better surveil
people. The Promise app perpetuates the existing issues in society and
the criminal justice system, and members of the class agreed that
there are privacy issues associated with it. Where the data goes is
important and matters; transparency regarding this should be
greater.</p>
<p>Despite these criticisms, people did bring up some benefits of the
Promise app such as it being an attempted fix that is easier than a
traditional ankle monitor. It is a step in the right direction even if
it will not be the final solution. Change will happen slowly, and it
is unlikely that we are able to fix systemic issues overnight. Another
important consideration that a person brought up was how do you make
software well, with a good business model, if it is not going to make
any profit? This addresses the issue of different companies only being
able to do so much with what they have. Change will take more than
just a few tech companies trying to solve these issues, it might even
require a societal shift.</p>
<p>Additionally, another follow-up question was posed: Would you work for
Promise over a “neutral” tech company? A strong majority (over 80%) of
the class indicated that they would work for Promise over a “neutral
tech company.” One classmate discussed how she would rather feel like
she was helping people and contributing to a social mission such as
Promise’s than none at all. For this reason, she would choose to work
for Promise over a “neutral” tech company. Professor Evans introduced
an interesting perspective by posing this idea that businesses who
claim to have a social mission should be held to a higher standard. He
also explained how he did not think Promise was represented very
fairly by Benjamin in the book (in particular, calling it Jay-Z&rsquo;s app,
rather than mentioning the actual founders and CEO of Promise,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedra_Ellis-Lamkins">Phaedra
Ellis-Lamkins</a>).</p>
<h4 id="selling-empathy">Selling Empathy</h4>
<p>Moving on from this discussion of Promise, we then began discussing
Benjamin’s concept of “selling empathy.” The following discussion
questions were posed:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Can seeing through another person’s eyes
actually help us understand them?</em></li>
<li><em>Could VR (or another technology) be
a viable tool for this?</em></li>
<li><em>Is empathy necessary to bring about change and
progress?</em> <em>Is it enough?</em></li>
<li><em>Benjamin provides Facebook’s VR app as an example of “selling
empathy”. What are some other instances of where trying to build
empathy can go wrong?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We discussed how VR is not a substitute for empathy, and creating
empathy is so much more complex than simply showing someone another
person’s experience. This technology can take advantage of victims and
burden those affected to have to try and help develop empathy in
others. As with everything, the VR experience will never be perfect,
and it will always be biased. What is lost and what is included are
significant in what is being provided to users. In answering these
questions, a debate between sympathy and empathy arose, and one
classmate suggested that these companies using VR are failing at
creating empathy by only really creating a face value sympathetic
understanding at best.</p>
<h4 id="explanations-under-attack">Explanations under Attack</h4>
<p>After the discussion on empathy, the class period was concluded with
this final discussion of adversarial models. If a model or algorithm
appears to output biased results, does knowing its inputs make a
difference? In other words, does it matter what its explanation is?
What are some of the ethical benefits and risks associated with
researching adversarial models?</p>
<p>People described being in favor of transparency and expressed that
being open to talk about problems is important. Even if being open
about the problem does not fix it, it is still a step closer to
solving it. You cannot always fix a problem if you do not know how it
is being created. One classmate described how adversarial models are
essentially a form of defensive cybersecurity; once you know how you
can be attacked, you can be wary of your vulnerabilities. It is also
important to be aware of oversights and blind spots by asking
questions about why results are biased.</p>
