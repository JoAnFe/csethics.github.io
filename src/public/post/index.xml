      <description>Tuesday, 2 February Please submit this survey by 4:59pm today (Tuesday): Initial Course Survey
Reading assignment: Ian Barbour, Ethics in an Age of Technology
This is from a 1993 book based on a series of lectures Barbour gave in 1989. Barbour considers three different views of technology: (1) Technology as Liberator, (2) Technology as Threat, and (3) Technology as Instrument of Power.
Before Wednesday at 9:29pm, post a response in the Discussion Site (see details there on what your response should be).</description>

      <description>A draft syllabus is now posted: Syllabus. This will give more of an idea what is planned for the class, but is incomplete and likely to change before the class starts.
The Discussion forum is now open!
The semester hasn&amp;rsquo;t started, students in this class will be interested in this seminar on Monday at 4pm: Timnit Gebru: Computer Vision - Who is helped and who is harmed? Dr. Gebru has been much in the news recently, and I expect this talk will be relevant to topics we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss in the first few weeks of the class.</description>

      <description>This post is preserved for persistence, but I am no longer taking additional students in the class through form submissions.  If you are interested in joining the class, please submit this form:
 https://forms.gle/xZECFhH7DNYHyc6X9  ### (or send me an email on ethical reasons why we shouldn&#39;t ask students to submit information like this using a google form). I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the course will be over-subscribed, but if the course fills up, I will be able to add a small number of additional students to the course who I will select based on these responses.</description>
