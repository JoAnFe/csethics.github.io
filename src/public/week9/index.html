<p>What do you think of the quote, “if you’re not paying for the product, you are the product”? How do you feel about the tradeoff between having a “free” website that includes targeting ads versus an ad-free website where you would have to pay to view the site? Are there other ways for “free” websites to make revenue?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Facebook’s response to the Social Dilemma’s portrayal of their recommendation system, they suggest that their platform “uses algorithms to improve the experience for people using [their] apps”, similar to other consumer-facing apps including Netflix. There are many criticisms of Netflix’s release of the film, as they are considered the pioneers of the modern recommendation system.

<p><strong>Team 5</strong></p>
<h2 id="tuesday-30-march">Tuesday 30 March</h2>
<p>We began Tuesday’s class with an acknowledgement of the fact that
there have long been studies of the harmful effects of social media
before the release of the Netflix documentary. Criticisms of the
documentary were presented, along with several notable Internet/media
scholars who have long studied this topic: Safiya Noble, Sarah
T. Roberts, and Siva Vaidhyanathan.</p>
<p>The Social Dilemma is then summarized as an intentional narrative that
reveals the consequences of society’s dependence on social media
through the life of a teenager while being narrated by experts,
investors, doctors, researchers, and former employees of big tech
companies.</p>
<p>The class then proceeds to conduct an activity in which every table
plays the social dilemma game, which is a bingo board of confessions
about social media usage. Each student would circle the confessions
that apply to him/her before discussing the results with the
group.</p>
<p>We then discussed these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you are on social media (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, etc.),
were you aware of the data privacy concerns brought up in the film?
Has your concern over data privacy on these platforms changed after
watching the film?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>80% of students mistake “sponsored content” ads for legitimate
news. [NPR, Stanford, 2016]. From what sources do you typically get
news and information? Do these feel trustworthy? How do you know that
is the case?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Many students in the class thought the questions were revealing but
also not surprising. Everyone seems to be aware of the data privacy
concerns but have only grown to be more concerned about these
platforms after watching the Netflix documentary. Many students do
typically get their news and information from social media, but also
quite a few state that they would seek out reputable news sources to
learn more.</p>
<p>Facebook’s response to the Netflix documentary is then analyzed by the
presenting group. It is pointed out that Facebook attempts to shift
the blame by explaining that the documentary has oversimplified a very
complex and nuanced set of issues. Facebook has addressed addiction
concerns by making changes to how News Feed works and work with mental
health experts to understand social media’s impact. Facebook claims
that users are not the product and its ad model is what enables the
platform’s high level of accessibility. Another criticism of the
documentary from Facebook is that the depiction of algorithms is
completely incorrect and user data privacy is taken very
seriously. Facebook is also conducting research to understand its
contributions to polarization, misinformation, and influences in
elections.</p>
<p>The following questions were posed to guide the students’ discussion
regarding Facebook’s response:</p>
<ol>
<li>What do you make of Facebook’s seven-point response to the film? Whose arguments do you find more convincing, the film’s or Facebook’s?</li>
<li>Of the seven claims made by Facebook, which do you feel are the most important that they stand by?  Do you think they followed through with their claims?</li>
<li>Do you have any suggestions that could make Facebook a safer platform overall?</li>
</ol>
<p>The class found Facebook’s response to be unconvincinga and
misleading. The claims are relatively vague and fail to address the
documentary’s pointed arguments about the company’s harms on
society. Legal regulations and antitrust efforts are possibilities
that can make Facebook a safer platform by forcing the company to
adhere to a certain standard, thereby realigning its financial
interest away from profiting off the feedback loop of user engagement,
data collection, and advertising.</p>
<h2 id="thursday-1-april">Thursday 1 April</h2>
<p>(Starts on Slide 24)</p>
<p>We started by discussing homework questions. This entailed talking
about what content do users get and how it is recommended. Students
tried out going incognito and searching hoaxes. They found the Youtube
algorithm tries to debunk certain hoaxes like Coronavirus not being
real.</p>
<p>Next we looked into Youtube’s recommendation algorithm. Youtube’s
recommendation algorithm uses two neural networks: candidate
generation to generate the recommendation and ranking to rank the
generated recommendations. The study “Algorithmic Extremism: Examining
Youtube’s Rabbit Hole of Radicalization” (2019) found the algorithm
does not promote radicalization after viewing polarizing
content. Facebook uses a multitask model and incorporates both
integrity processes and a contextual pass in its recommendation
algorithm.</p>
<p>The Investigating Ad Transparency reading discussed how the concerns
about transparency of social media led to social media platforms
offering transparency mechanisms. Examples include Facebook’s “why am
I seeing this?” ad explanations and ad reference page explaining
inferred data on the user. The study examines transparency in ad
explanations and data inference.</p>
<p>The 3 methods of advertiser targeting mentioned include traditional
Facebook targeting, data broker targeting, and advertise personally
identifiable information (PII) targeting. Traditional Facebook
targeting exploits demographics, interests, behavior, and cookies for
tracking outside Facebook activity. Data broker targeting, which
accounts for 45% of attributes, captures financial information such as
income and information from offline sources like criminal
records. Advertiser PII targeting uses pre-collected information to
target consumers on Facebook. The process for receiving an Ad requires
the data inference process to determine user attributes, the audience
selection process maps targeted attributes to advertisers, and the
user-ad matching process matches users with particular attributes to
advertisers.</p>
<p>We then had an activity on searching what Facebook set as our
interests that determines what ads we see on its platforms. The
discussion questions were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Were you surprised by any of your assigned categories?</li>
<li>How did you feel after seeing some of the information/assumptions Facebook has about you?</li>
</ol>
<p>Some people saw that the assigned categories Facebook set about them
were very inaccurate whereas some were accurate.  This may have been
due to the fact that some people didn’t use Facebook as much as
others. Some people noted that they don&rsquo;t use Facebook, but do use
Instagram, and were surprised how much profile information was found
in their Facebook account. Of course, Facebook owns Instagram, so has
many ways to link accounts between the two services even if users do
not explicitly link them.</p>
<p>Next we discussed the study assessing Facebook ad explanations:
Athanasios Andreou, Giridhari Venkatadri, Oana Goga, Krishna
P. Gummadi, Patrick Loiseau, Alan Mislove. <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ndss2018_10-1_Andreou_paper.pdf"><em>Investigating Ad
Transparency Mechanisms in Social Media: A Case Study of Facebook’s
Explanations</em></a>. NDSS
2018.</p>
<p>Andreou et. al. defined five key categories: correctness, all
attributes are used by advertisers; personalization, whether or not
the attributes specific to a user are displayed; completeness, whether
or not all attributes are displayed; consistency, how similar
explanations are across users; and determinism, whether explanations
are the same for ads with same targeting attributes. The study found
Facebook contained potential attributes that were never specified by
the user and that explanations can be different for users. Some
attribute types, like demographics, have a higher priority in
explanation.</p>
<p>Transparency in data is also lacking. Data-broker targeting is not
disclosed on Facebook, and Advertiser PII targeting is disclosed by
saying “you’re on their customer list” but does not explain what PII
the advertiser provided. Data explanations were analyzed by:
specificity of explanation, snapshot completeness of explanation (does
it show all inferred attributes), temporal completeness (does it show
all inferred attributes over period of time), correctness (does it
show activity that led to inference). Explanations clearly specified a
source of the attribute. However, no data broker attributes are
explained, nor is historical information about inferred attributes
explained. Consequently, data explanations are not complete. We then
followed up with the following discussion questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How bothered are you that Facebook doesn’t show you the entire ad explanation? (Note: this may have changed since publication in 2018)</li>
<li>Did anything from the study surprise you?</li>
<li>According to Facebook, “all election and issue ads on Facebook and Instagram in the US must be clearly labeled, including a “Paid For By” disclosure from the advertiser at the top of the ad.” Can you think of other steps Facebook and other companies can take or have already taken to increase their ad transparency?</li>
</ol>
<p>Students found they were not too bothered by the lack of ad
explanation since this is in their best interest. Students also added
giving out explanations could help other companies and that unless
there is user backlash or legal reasons it might be better not to
include explanations. Students did not find the content of the study
surprising, and found that Facebook could increase transparency by
having explanations for specific ads such as attributes like age
range.</p>
<p>AdAnalyst was introduced as a resource that allows users to check what
advertisers are targeting them, who receives the same ads, and what
Facebook knows about them.</p>
<p>The video by Joe Toscano was then introduced: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDboy_RMaXk"><em>Want to Work for
Google? You Already
Do.</em></a>. The video was made
by a former consultant at Google that left due to ethical
concerns. Toscano argues tech companies use user data to generate
profit, and that we should have ownership of our own data. Legislation
in this direction has been passed: Wyoming passed legislation making
digital assets personal property and California passed the Consumer
Privacy Act. The following discussion questions were posed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Toscano criticizes Tesla for using large amounts of their consumers’ data. Data from all Tesla vehicles are sent to the cloud, which is used to create highly data-dense maps that helps develop their Autopilot AI. Do you think a shift to owning our own data could hinder technological innovation if companies like Tesla no longer have access to large amounts of data?</li>
<li>Towards the end of the video, Toscano says “imagine living in a world where the terms of service is written in a language we can understand and reasonably be expected to give consent to imagine”. A recent study conducted by Deloitte found that 91% of people consent to terms and services conditions without reading them. Do you think it is the role of the consumer to try to interpret the language used in the conditions? What steps, other than Toscano’s suggestions, can companies take in order to assist the consumers’ understanding of how their data is being used?</li>
</ol>
<p>Students found the shift to ownership of personal data could
potentially hinder innovation. Students also found that to an extent
it is the role of the consumer to interpret language used in the
conditions and terms, but that it should still be readable.</p>
