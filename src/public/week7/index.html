<p><strong>Team 3</strong></p>
<p>Group 5 led this week’s discussion on the topic of social credit, as
exemplified by China’s growing social credit system (SCS). The SCS was
launched in 2014 and aimed to assess the trustworthiness of Chinese
citizens in meeting their contractual obligations.</p>
<h2 id="tuesday-16-march">Tuesday, 16 March</h2>
<p>To open up Tuesday’s class, we participated in a game of Kahoot that
was made in an effort to capture our classmates’ views on the concept
of social scoring. Even though the class had various opinions on
social scoring, most students had moderate views on the subject. This
is most likely due to the fact that there are many ethical issues
regarding social credit systems. Finally, the entire class agreed that
extreme examples of social scoring, such as displaying a score on a
social media profile, would be a breach of civil liberties.</p>
<p>Later in the class, we discussed how the Kahoot game had its own
version of social scoring. Due to the fact that all of the answers in
the Kahoot were correct, the evaluation of players was determined by
the speed at which one answered the questions.  This reiterated the
concept of social scoring and added the additional factor of making it
public, thereby incentivizing people to perform well, even though
everyone knew there were not any incorrect answers.</p>
<p>We then focused the discussion on our interactions with credit score
systems, specifically in the United States with the FICO credit
scoring system. A common topic in the discussion was financial advice
given to some of the students, by their parents. Some students’
parents advised them to begin establishing credit early and to use
credit cards to make smaller purchases at places like the grocery
store or gas station. Many also acknowledged that if their families
did not have access to certain resources, like stable jobs and the
opportunity to learn financial literacy, they would be less likely to
have established credit early on. As a result, several students
advocated for stronger financial literacy programs in public
education.</p>
<p>The next set of discussion questions centered on whether businesses
should be required to accept physical cash. This is a point of
contention as buying goods with cash creates a level of anonymity and
allows customers without good credit scores or without credit cards in
general to purchase products. However, it is more difficult for
businesses to conduct business in this manner. China differs from the
United States with credit/social scoring as China monitors purchases
made by a customer. These purchases may increase or decrease one&rsquo;s
social credit depending on what types of purchases the consumer is
buying as described in the reading, <a href="https://archive.is/aTTT7"><em>Inside China’s Vast New Experiment
in Social Ranking</em></a>, written by Mara Hvistendahl.</p>
<p>A sanction is a threatened penalty for disobeying a law or rule, and
sanctioning was briefly discussed regarding the SCS. Sanctions in the
SCS include a lot of things such as being banned from traveling or
even attending specific schools, which can negatively impact citizens’
social life and professional careers. Although the SCS is linked to a
process of sanctions and rewards, we learned that the consequences of
such sanctions are not always ethical. In groups, we discussed the
possibility of China having stronger legislation and laws on data
privacy as well, so that citizens do not feel pressured to do
activities deemed “good” by society all of the time. Thus, to maintain
civil freedoms in China, the government would need to loosen up on
sanctions and solidify legislation on data privacy. We also discussed
the topic of blacklisting and red-listing citizens and came to the
conclusion that sanctions should not be irreversible and people with
less serious offenses should be given a second chance.</p>
<p>This week’s required viewing was an episode titled
[<em>Nosedive</em>](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosedive_(Black_Mirror)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosedive_(Black_Mirror)</a> from
the television series <em>Black Mirror</em>. In this episode, the heavy
reliance on the social credit system used in the society leads the
protagonist on a journey that ends with her score dropping very
rapidly in a short period of time, hence the title of the episode. For
people who grew up in the US and were familiar with the basics of the
credit system in the country, the episode seemed to progress
naturally, if the social and credit scoring system were implemented to
that extent. Societal views and implementation of the social scoring
system in the countries of America and China vary. Additionally, a
student in our discussion grew up in China and participated in the
social credit system. He mentioned that the use of the social credit
system really did not impact his day-to-day life. The most drastic
control measures demonstrated in the <em>Nosedive</em> episode, such as not
allowing someone to buy a plane ticket, was not something that he had
experienced or witnessed inside of his social circle.</p>
<p>So, what are the ethical questions the social credit system creates?
Some of the questions being raised during this discussion stemmed from
the lack of transparency that companies have with their consumers
about what components the credit score is composed of. Other issues
brought up included privacy rights, and even social Darwinism as
people would try to only associate themselves with others with high
scores as a way to increase their own social status.</p>
<p>One important question that we failed to address in Tuesday’s class
was whether these systems be allowed. Without a credit system, how do
you establish trust between banks and their customers?  The reasoning
behind a credit system is to create a sense of trust that allows
customers to borrow money when needed and to allow social mobility for
social-based systems. Indeed, it is the spread of trusted credit
records that have enabled a large fraction of the population to be
able to obtain credit.</p>
<h2 id="thursday-18-march">Thursday, 18 March</h2>
<p>On Thursday, we opened with a poll that asked us to share how many
hours we spend on social media daily and which forms of social media
we use the most. Most people in the class averaged around two to three
hours per day on many different types of social media. This included
apps such as Discord, Twitter, Snapchat, Reddit, and TikTok. We were
also quick to note that the nature of online schooling has essentially
required everyone to spend most of their days in front of a computer
or smartphone screen.</p>
<p>This then opened up the discussion of whether a social media platform
can be designed to be engaging while remaining ethical. Most of us
agreed that these companies are not incentivized to not actively drive
engagement, since it is the source of their profits. We also discussed
the idea of Instagram removing the visibility of the number of likes
from posts, but we agreed that users would always just find another
number to fixate on, like follower counts.</p>
<p>With the thought of incentives on our minds, we then turned
to further discuss credit systems in both the U.S. and in China. These
systems were created with the intent to promote good behavior thereby
making society better as a whole. We discussed how these credit
systems are already present in various forms in society. For example,
Uber&rsquo;s star system allows both passengers and drivers to rate each
other. As several classmates noted, some of these systems are not
easily reversible. However, all of the systems in the US, while not
all-encompassing, signal value to others. For instance, a college
degree from a prestigious university carries a positive value to
others, while a poor review on Uber may signal to others that you are
less trustworthy. Thus, these systems are already in our American
society, just not to the extent that it is implemented in China.</p>
<p>We then turned our attention to a rebuttal of China’s social systems
as being Orwellian. This was expanded upon in Horsley’s article, where
the author discussed that China’s social credit systems were not as
controlling as one may think. We then discussed the implications and
the possibilities behind Horsley’s argument. Additionally, one student
noted that while this currently may be the case, China is moving
towards a much more controlled society than the article asserts.</p>
<p>The discussion then moved to the ethics of the CCP’s social credit
system and multiple negative opinions of the system were given. Most
notably, the ability of the CCP to use the social credit system to
assist in the genocide of its Muslim population, as well as uses of
the social credit system to undermine or reward those who the state
deems “bad” and “good” respectively. One argument was brought up that
the article written by Horsley might have been true at the time of her
writing the article, which was in 2009. Since then, many things have
changed in China, and the CCP has pushed the social credit system
further. Again, we noted that due to global politics oftentimes the
information that we glean from the media has been propagandized to fit
a certain narrative. On the other hand, we also acknowledge that the
CCP’s AI policies, especially with the social credit system, are being
used in ways that multiple, oftentimes at odds with each other, like
the US and Iran, countries and cultures have condoned.</p>
<p>We also discussed the ethical implications of getting loans through
companies using algorithms to judge us based on various factors like a
credit score even if it resembles the social scoring method in
<em>Nosedive</em>. Everyone seemed to agree that the credit scoring process
we have is reasonable and ethical because we know what is being
factored into our score, it is not invasive to our privacy, and is not
impacted by the people we surround ourselves with. Also, only certain
entities can know our scores, like banks and employers. This differed
from the system used in <em>Nosedive</em> as one’s social score was public to
everyone.</p>
<p>As we wrapped up this week’s topic on social credit systems and the
role that technology plays in these systems, we again discussed Black
Mirror’s <em>Nosedive</em> episode and the parallels between real life, and
the possible warnings the show was attempting to notify its viewers
of. This included the impact of how social media can reflect societal
value and the result of how instant gratification of viewing people
created could create a potentially toxic feedback loop. The episode
also demonstrated how easy it was to spiral from a good social status
to a poor one due to external events.</p>
<p>Social credit systems and linking certain values and trustworthiness
to numbers and algorithms has raised many important questions to
consider as we prepare for our futures in the technology industry.</p>
