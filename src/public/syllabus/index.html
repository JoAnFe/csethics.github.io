<p><strong>Course Description:</strong></p>
<p>Most decisions today are made by software, most of the rules of
society are interpreted and enforced by programs, and much human
interaction is now mediated by computing platforms that decide what
people see and who they can talk to. As the people who decide what
software gets written and how it is deployed, computer scientists have
disproportionate power to mold society â€” for both good and bad.
This will be a discussion and project-based seminar focused on ethical
issues faced by computing systems and the people who design, build,
and deploy them.</p>
<p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The goal of this course is to raise awareness
and increase understanding of the moral and ethical aspects of
computing systems. This course is more about raising questions and
developing intellectual frameworks for thinking about difficult
problems than about developing technical skills. Few, if any, of the
problems we will discuss have easy answers, but hopefully we will have
an engaging time discussing them and develop more sophisticated ways
of thinking about them.</p>
<p><strong>Class Meetings:</strong> The scheduled course meetings are Tuesdays and
Thursdays at 9:30-10:45am. Because this is a discussion-based
course, it is essential that students attend and fully participate
in the scheduled class meetings.</p>
<p>All planned meetings will be conducted on-line, with no expectations
for in person meetings. (In the happy, but unlikely, event that we
are all fully vaccinated before the end of the semester, we might
have an in person meeting, but we won&rsquo;t do this until it is
confirmed that everyone in the class has completed the vaccination
schedule.)</p>
<p><strong>Pandemic.</strong> The challenges we are facing with the current pandemic
places our community under tremendous stress, and we appreciate that
many of our students are dealing with extreme personal challenges this
semester. You should prioritize your own physical and mental health,
and the well-being of your friends and family, over any class.</p>
<p>I endeavor to teach the class in a way that provides an experience
that is as valuable as what you would receive if we were able to hold
in person classes, but know that remote learning presents substantial
challenges, and that many students will have circumstances that make
things especially difficult. I want the class to be a low stress, high
value experience for everyone.</p>
<p>I will do everything I can to accommodate students varying
situations, and to ensure that every student has the best opportunity
possible to succeed in the class and have a good experience.  Please
communicate with me (Dave) to let us know about difficulties you are
facing, or anything I can do to make things better for you.</p>
<h1 id="preparation">Preparation</h1>
<p>We expect students entering cs3501 to be familiar enough with computer
science and software development to be able to read technical papers
and engage in discussions about how we build and evaluate computing
systems. We will discuss topics that involve machine learning,
cryptography, and network protocols, but do not expect all students
to have previous background in these areas.</p>
<h1 id="instructor">Instructor</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans">David Evans</a></p>
<p>This is the first time this course (or anything similar) has been
offered. Although this course will be quite different from any
previous course I have taught, my closest previous course is a a
Pavillion Seminar on <a href="https://aipavilion.github.io/"><em>How will Artificial Intelligence Change
Humanity?</em></a>. I have also taught courses
on <a href="https://secml.github.io/"><em>Security and Privacy of Machine
Learning</em></a>, <a href="https://uvammm.github.io/"><em>Markets, Mechanisms, and
Machines</em></a>, and
<a href="https://bitcoin-class.org/">cryptocurrencies</a>, which might include
some of the topics we will touch on in this class.</p>
<p><strong>Email:</strong> Students should feel free to email me at
<a href="evans@virginia.edu"><em>evans@virginia.edu</em></a> anytime and about anything
you would like to discuss or think it would be good for me to know. I
usually respond to emails quickly and reliably (at least I try to!),
so if you don&rsquo;t hear back within 24 hours, please send a follow-up
reminder.</p>
<p><strong>Office Hours and Scheduling Meetings:</strong> I will hold open office
hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays after class. You don&rsquo;t need to
schedule an appointment to come to office hours - they are open to
everyone. If you would like to schedule a meeting at another time,
use
<a href="https://davidevans.youcanbook.me/"><em>https://davidevans.youcanbook.me/</em></a>
to schedule a time (if you can&rsquo;t find anything that works there, email me your scheduling constraints).</p>
<h1 id="communication">Communication</h1>
<p>We will primarily use the course website for one-to-many
communications (posting course materials) and the <a href="https://github.com/csethics/csethics.github.io/discussions">github
Discussions</a>
site for interactive discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Course Website:</strong> All course materials that can be posted publicly
will be posted at
<a href="https://csethics.github.io"><em>https://csethics.github.io</em></a>. We may
occasionally use the collab site to post materials we cannot post
publicly.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> We will use the github discussions site for
interactive discussions:
<a href="https://github.com/csethics/csethics.github.io/discussions"><em>https://github.com/csethics/csethics.github.io/discussions</em></a>. (See more about this below.)</p>
<h1 id="course-format">Course Format</h1>
<p>The course will be divided into five teams of five students each. Most
weeks, one of the teams will be responsible for leading the class; one
of the teams will be responsible for writing the blog post about the
week; and the remaining students will be responsible for writing short
reaction posts and engaging in the discussion both on-line and in
class.</p>
<p>The standard week for the course will be something like this:</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday night (or earlier):</strong> Reading/Viewing Assignment specified</p>
<p><strong>Sunday, 10:59pm:</strong> Initial responses to reading assignment due (posted in Discussions forum)</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday, 9:30-10:45am:</strong> Class meeting (first meeting on the week&rsquo;s topic)</p>
<p>The team leading the week should have a plan for what to do both
Tuesday and Thursday, but should be adaptive to what happens in class
on Tuesday. This could include assigning additional (but not overly
time consuming) tasks for students to do before Thursday, as well as
provoking on-line discussion that would build on the in-class
discussions Tuesday, and set-up the Thursday meeting.</p>
<p>Before Tuesday&rsquo;s class meeting, the group responsible for leading the
following week&rsquo;s discussions should have prepared a plan and candidate
list of materials for the next week (with my help), and meet with me
after class Tuesday to finalize the plan for the following week.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday, 9:30-10:45am:</strong> Class meeting (second and final meeting on
the week&rsquo;s topic)</p>
<h2 id="projectspapers">Projects/Papers</h2>
<p>Students will work on a semester-long project that can take the form
of a paper, video, or computing artifact. The project should have some
connection to the goals of the class, but these are interpreted
broadly. The project can be done individually or in a team, but team
projects must have ambition commensurate with the team size. My hope
is the students to do projects that will be valuable and worthwhile to
them personally as experience, but that will result in something of
value beyond just as a course project.</p>
<p>Some ideas for potential projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Select a software system deployed at UVA (e.g., SIS or anything used
by this course) and evaluate it from an ethical viewpoint and
considering how it could be designed to better serve some ethical
goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select a research paper in a recent conference, and evaluate its
ethical aspects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a paper that explores some ethical issue in computing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop a web or mobile application that illustrates something
relevant to this class (e.g., <a href="https://whitecollar.thenewinquiry.com/"><em>White Collar Early Warning
System</em></a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider a professional code of ethics (e.g., <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">ACM Code of Ethics
and Processional Conduct</a>) and
evaluate how useful it is in guiding difficult decisions as well as
the ethical framework it assumes; evaluate how well the ACM (or
other organization) actually follows its own ethics code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be several intermediate project milestones during the
semester, listed on the course schedule, and students will present
their projects during the final week of class (May 4 and May 6).</p>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
<p>Grades will be determined based on four main components:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>(30%) Contributions fo the Class Discussions: this includes posting
your responses to the readings, participating constructively in the
on-line forum, and engaging usefully during the class
meetings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(25%) Leading Classes: for the weeks where your team is leading the
class, you will be evaluated on the plans for the week, how well they
are executed, and how well you work together as a team. If the team
works well together and everyone on the team contributes equitably,
everyone will receive the same grade; if the team does not work
together well, or individuals do not contribute equally to the team&rsquo;s
success, students will be graded based on their individual
contributions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(15%) Blogging classes: for the weeks where your team is
responsible for writing the blog summary, you will be evaluated on the
quality of the content and writing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(30%) Projects</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These weightings are just a rough guideline, and they will be adjusted
on a case-by-case basis to reward students who make outstanding
contributions in any areas.</p>
<h1 id="creating-a-safe-and-engaging-community">Creating a Safe and Engaging Community</h1>
<p>One of the topics we will discuss in the class is the tension between
free speech and protecting society and individuals from harmful
speech, and the challenges communication and publishing platforms have
in deciding which constraints should be placed on users, and when
people should be banished from the platform (and when platforms should
be banished from other platforms for failing to do this adequately).</p>
<p>Because of the trusting and respectful community we are fortunate to
have at the University of Virginia, balancing these goals should be
easier for our class than it is for open Internet platforms. Still, we
will discuss many difficult and sensitive topics in this class, and we
want everyone to feel like they can discuss freely and to express
contrarian opinions without fear of retribution, but also to avoid
offending or traumatizing others.  For this to work, everyone should:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Start from a presumption of mutual respect, and acknowledging that
we all have different experiences and backgrounds, and that the
experiences others have had may not be what you would guess.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assume everyone in the class is well-meaning and that if something
someone says seems offensive, to give them the benefit of the doubt
that it is a result of careless wording, lack of experience, or
misspeaking rather than of hateful intent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But, not to tolerate offensive conduct from others. If someone says
or does something that is hurtful or insensitive, to respectfully
raise the issue and hope that it can be a learning and growing
experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At times, you may be asked to argue for positions that are the
opposite of what you believe. This is one of the best ways to
understand other perspectives, as well as to develop one&rsquo;s rhetorical
skills.</p>
<h2 id="privacy-and-anonymity">Privacy and anonymity</h2>
<p>Another thing we want to balance in this seminar is the desire to have
an open course where the things we do may be valuable to the outside
world, and to provide the advantages of anonymity in open
discourse. For most of the course assignments, as well as the open
discussion, we will be using the github
<a href="https://github.com/csethics/csethics.github.io/discussions">Discussion</a>
site. To participate in the class, students will either need at least
one github account, or to make a convincing argument why they are
uncomfortable with this (in which case I will find an alternative).</p>
<p>The discussion site is publicly visible, which I think is usually a
good thing and I hope will end up resulting in content that will be
valuable beyond just this class, but is important to be aware of if
you are posting something that some might consider controversial (and
we do want this to be a place where contraian and dangerous ideas can
be safely discussed without fear of repercussions).</p>
<p>You are encouraged to create a new github account with a pseudonym
that is not connected to your known identity to participate in the
on-line course discussions, and can use multiple pseudonyms if you
would like. The one constraint is that if you would like to get credit
(as far as course evaluation is concerned) for your contributions to
the discussion, you should let me know the pseudonym you are using
(which I will keep confidential). If you want to post using a
pseudonym that is not known to me, that is fine (but won&rsquo;t be possible
to count this towards your class contribution).</p>
<h1 id="honor-expectations">Honor Expectations</h1>
<p>We believe strongly in the value of a community of trust, and expect
all of the students in this class to contribute to strengthening and
enhancing that community. The course will be better for everyone if
everyone can assume everyone else is trustworthy. I start with the
assumption that all students at the university deserve to be trusted.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration Policy:</strong> For some assignments in this class you will
work in teams; for other assignments, you are expected to work on
your own. It should be clear which is which, and since most
submissions are submitted to the Discussions forum, it would be
silly to misrepresent someone else&rsquo;s work as your own. I aim to make
the language describing the policy as clear and unambiguous as
possible, but if anything is ever unclear about the stated policy
for an assignment, please clarify with me. The penalty for policy
violations will be considered on a case-by-case basis, with a
penalty commensurate the severity of the offense.</p>
<h1 id="additional-information">Additional Information</h1>
<p><strong>Special Circumstances:</strong> The University of Virginia strives to provide accessibility to all students. If you require an accommodation to fully access this course, please contact the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) at (434) 243-5180 or <code>sdac@virginia.edu</code>. If you are unsure if you require an accommodation, or to learn more about their services, you may contact the SDAC at the number above or by visiting their website <a href="https://studenthealth.virginia.edu/sdac">https://studenthealth.virginia.edu/sdac</a></p>
<p><strong>Conflicts:</strong> It is our policy and practice to reasonably accommodate
students so that they do not experience an adverse academic
consequence when personal or family responsibilities, sincerely held
religious beliefs or observances, or essential and inflexible
activities (this might include academic conferences, music
performances, and athletic events) conflict with academic
expectations.  The university has a specific policy
for <a href="https://eocr.virginia.edu/accommodations-religious-observance">academic accommodations for religious observance or religious
beliefs</a>
which this course will follow, but we do not consider religious
observances to be more important than other kinds of important
personal obligations which students do not have scheduling control
over. If something is going on that conflicts with your coming to
class or doing the assignments, please let me know about it.</p>
<p><strong>Safe Environment:</strong> The University of Virginia is dedicated to
providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all
students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that we
and the University hold as critically important:</p>
<ol>
<li>Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated.</li>
<li>Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on grounds (including in virtual environments).</li>
</ol>
<p>If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal
violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence
website that describes reporting options and resources available:
<a href="https://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence">https://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence</a>.</p>
<p>As your professors and as humans, know that we each care about you and
your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as we
can. As faculty members, we are responsible employees, which means
that we are required by University policy and federal law to report
what you tell us to the University&rsquo;s Title IX Coordinator. The Title
IX Coordinator&rsquo;s job is to ensure that the reporting student receives
the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the
information presented to determine whether further action is necessary
to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University
community. If you would rather keep this information confidential,
there are Confidential Employees you can talk to on Grounds (see
<a href="https://eocr.virginia.edu/chart-confidential-resources">https://eocr.virginia.edu/chart-confidential-resources</a>  ). The
worst possible situation would be for you or your friend to remain
silent when there are so many here willing and able to help.</p>
<p><strong>Well-being:</strong> If you are feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or isolated,
there are many individuals here who are ready and wanting to help. The
Student Health Center offers Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) for all UVA students. Call 434-243-5150 (or 434-972-7004 for
after hours and weekend crisis assistance) to get started and schedule
an appointment. If you prefer to speak anonymously and confidentially
over the phone, Madison House provides a HELP Line at any hour of any
day: 434-295-8255.</p>
