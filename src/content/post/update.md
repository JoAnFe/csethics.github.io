A draft syllabus is now posted: [Syllabus](/syllabus). This will give
more of an idea what is planned for the class, but is incomplete and
likely to change before the class starts.

The [Discussion](https://github.com/csethics/csethics.github.io/discussions) forum is now open!

The semester hasn't started, students in this class will be interested in this seminar on Monday at 4pm: [Timnit Gebru: _Computer Vision - Who is helped and who is harmed?_](https://github.com/csethics/csethics.github.io/discussions/5)

I will post more details on the reading/viewing list soon, but if
you'd like to get an early start, one of the first major readings we
will do is Ruha Benjamin's book, [_Race After
Technology_](https://www.ruhabenjamin.com/race-after-technology).
