The readings for Week 10 (April 6 and 8 on Privacy and Surveillance) are now posted: [Week 10 Readings and Discussion](https://github.com/csethics/csethics.github.io/discussions/35).

Also, remember that your Project Progress Report is due on
**Wednesday, 7 April (4:59pm)**. It should be an update on your
project and what you have done so far, and what you plan to do for the
remainder. This should be sent as an email to me (evans@virginia.edu)
with all of your teammates cc'd. It can be plain text in the email, or
an attached PDF, containing at least this information:

1. Title for your project
2. How your purpose, plan, and hoped outcome have changed from the original proposal. For most projects, this should at least be refining your idea from the proposal; for some, you may have changed direction, and then should explain the reason for this and how things have changed.
3. What you have done so far
4. Your plan for completing the project - what you will do over the final weeks of the semester, and where you hope to get by the final deadline.
