I am expecting to offer a similar course in Spring 2022, but still
waiting for decisions from our department administration to be able to
confirm this and provide more details officially. Although the course
is listed as a "cs4501" in SIS now, it will most likely end up listed
as a "cs3501" course. It will be open to all students, with expected
backgound of students entering the course to be familiar enough with
computer science and software development to be able to read technical
papers and engage in discussions about how we build and evaluate
computing systems. We will discuss topics that involve machine
learning, cryptography, and network protocols, but do not expect all
students to have previous background in these areas.
