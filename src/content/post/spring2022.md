I am expecting to offer a similar course in Spring 2022, but still
waiting for decisions from our department administration to be able to
confirm this and provide more details officially. Although the course
is listed as a "cs4501" in SIS now, it will most likely end up listed
as a "cs3501" course. It will be open to all students, with expected
backgound of students entering the course to be familiar enough with
computer science and software development to be able to read technical
papers and engage in discussions about how we build and evaluate
computing systems. We will discuss topics that involve machine
learning, cryptography, and network protocols, but do not expect all
students to have previous background in these areas.

The format will adapt to the in-person environment we expect to be
able to have in Spring 2022 (unlike the Spring 2021 course which we
entirely virtual and designed around that environment). But,
otherwise, we expect the course to be fairly similar in the kinds of
topics we cover and way of running the course to the Spring 2021
course. You can get a good idea of how that course went from this
website.

Once the department has confirmed the course offering, I'll update
this site with a more formal syllabus for the Spring 2022 course.

Sorry, looks like things have changed again. I'm not sure if this
course will be offered again, but will update this here when I know more.
