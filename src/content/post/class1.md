**Reading assignment:** Ian Barbour, [_Ethics in an Age of Technology_](/docs/barbour-views-of-technology.pdf)

This is from a 1993 book based on a series of lectures Barbour gave in
1989. Barbour considers three different views of technology: (1)
Technology as Liberator, (2) Technology as Threat, and (3) Technology
as Instrument of Power.

Before **Wednesday at 9:29pm**, post a response in the [Discussion
Site](https://github.com/csethics/csethics.github.io/discussions/7#discussion-2560242)
(see details there on what your response should be). (Note that it
will get harder to post a satisfactory response as more students have
posted, so it is advantageous to do this earlier and have more
opportunities for discussion.)
