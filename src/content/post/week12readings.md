The readings for Week 12 (April 20 and 22 on Antitrust) are now
posted: [Week 12 Readings and
Discussion](https://github.com/csethics/csethics.github.io/discussions/37). Team
4 has planned an exciting Mock Trial for week 12!

There's no class tomorrow (Thursday 15 April) - hope everyone enjoys
the Break Day and finds a way to make it refreshing (if you have no other plans, you may find [watching this congressional hearing](https://www.c-span.org/video/?474236-1/heads-facebook-amazon-apple-google-testify-antitrust-law) to be quite relaxing and reaffirming!)
