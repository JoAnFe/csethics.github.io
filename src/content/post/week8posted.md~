The blog summary for week 7 is now posted: [Week 7](/week7).

Thanks to Team 3 for writing the blog, and to Team 5 for leading!

I've also updated the [Week 6](/week6) post on the projects, with more
information on the next deliverable:

- _Project Progress Report_ due **Wednesday, 7 April (4:59pm)**:

Update on your project and what you have done so far, and what you
  plan to do for the remainder. This should be sent as an email to me
  (evans@virginia.edu) with all of your teammates cc'd. It can be
  plain text in the email, or an attached PDF, containing at least
  this information:

1. Title for your project
2. How your purpose, plan, and hoped outcome have changed from the original proposal. For most projects, this should at least be refining your idea from the proposal; for some, you may have changed direction, and then should explain the reason for this and how things have changed.
3. What you have done so far
4. Your plan for completing the project - what you will do over the final weeks of the semester, and where you hope to get by the final deadline.
