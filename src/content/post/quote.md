_Scientists are some of the most dangerous people in the world because
we have this illusion of objectivity; there is this illusion of
meritocracy and there is this illusion of searching for objective
truth._
Timnit Gebru (quoted in [_Dealing With Bias in Artificial Intelligence_](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/technology/artificial-intelligence-bias.html)), New York Times, 19 November 2019)
