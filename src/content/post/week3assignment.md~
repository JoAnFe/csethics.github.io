A new version of the [Schedule](/schedule) is now posted!

It includes the planned topics for the weeks, and should be easier to
understand than the original schedule.

It worked out for every team to have their top choices as topics, and
I think we have a good mix of topics through the semesters. Nothing is
set in stone, though, so if your team decides you want to switch your
topics (without duplicating something another team is already
scheduled to do), let me know and we can change things.
