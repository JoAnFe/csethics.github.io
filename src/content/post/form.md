If you are interested in joining the class, please submit this form:

<center>
<a href="https://forms.gle/xZECFhH7DNYHyc6X9"><em>https://forms.gle/xZECFhH7DNYHyc6X9</em></a>
</center>
(or send me an email on ethical reasons why we shouldn't ask students
to submit information like this using a google form).

I'm not sure if the course will be over-subscribed, but if the course
fills up, I will be able to add a small number of additional students
to the course who I will select based on these responses.
