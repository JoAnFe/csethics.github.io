The discussions posts for the next two weeks are now posted:
- [Week 6 &mdash; Projects](https://github.com/csethics/csethics.github.io/discussions/22). We have a "Break Day" on Tuesday (March 9), so only one class next week and no assigned readings or discussion. Please read the post though, and start thinking about ideas for projects.
- [Week 7 &mdash; Social Scoring](https://github.com/csethics/csethics.github.io/discussions/23). Note the (totally optional) scheduled [Black Mirror "Nosedive" viewing party](https://virginia.zoom.us/s/96591977405?pwd=aGVYb1ZCK0Q1NDZPL3BuUUhoZm90QT09#success) on Saturday, March 13 at 5pm.
