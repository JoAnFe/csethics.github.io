**Team 4**

### Tuesday 23 March

We began our Tuesday class by reviewing the assigned reading and going
right into discussion questions. We reviewed [_The Good, the Bad and
the Ugly of Ethics in UX
Design_](https://uxpamagazine.org/building-an-ethics-framework-for-ux-design-part-2/)
article and then discussed if those who influence the design are also
considered the designers. Most of the discussion groups agreed that
anyone who influences the design becomes the designer, including the
developers, PMs, and even corporate legal. Most saw design as a
profitable system, and whoever was a part of that system and profited
from the product, was included as a designer. To further discuss the
benevolent intent of design, groups debated whether or not a
struggling tech company was allowed to disregard some UI ethics in
order to save resources. Most of the groups surprisingly went with "yes"
but included some caveats such as acknowledging the fact that they
don’t have the resources yet, but will make it a future goal to
include these designs. Some groups also came up with the idea that it
is the government’s responsibility to fiscally support these smaller
companies so that they would be able to include these UI ethics in
their designs. This idea branched from the already-established design
that governments provide tax breaks for small businesses compared to
big businesses.

After this lively debate, the class dove into the hot topic of
Nextdoor amplifying the racial profiling of certain people in their
neighborhoods and how Nextdoor is addressing the problem. We reviewed
how Nextdoor introduced the idea of “friction,” or the utility of
interruptions, that warns or reminds the users that their actions
affect people beyond who we immediately can see. The introduction of
friction to technology can be seen as a warning or a pop-up box to
slow the user down and pull themselves back into reality. Our class
wanted to know whether or not the introduction of friction into their
technology was enough fixing for Nextdoor to now be unbiased or if
they were still an example of racist tech. Unsurprisingly, most groups
still felt that Nextdoor is an example of racist tech because although
it might not have racist intentions, it perpetuates negative social
biases. Nextdoor’s inclusion of small quick fixes does not actually
change the product as a whole; Nextdoor still amplifies existing
negative social biases and the app’s main purpose of involving
neighborhoods and zip codes reveals these negative social biases at
the local level.

Our next discussion was on Haben Girma and her [talk at
Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44VEwsBfux0). Girma was the
first deafblind graduate from Harvard Law. Girma gave a speech at
Google to bring up the idea that there is incredible potential in
technology and developers must not stop finding new ways to present
information and reach new people. She gave some suggestions to the
employees of Google, including ideas such as ensuring apps are
compatible with accessibility technologies by including hooks like
closed captioning and screen readers, expanding the functionality of
Google Maps to be more compatible with a screen reader, and
incorporating accessibility from the beginning and then testing along
the way. The suggestions she provided were to ensure that the
developers at Google were continuously coming up with solutions that
rethink the norm and help people in more ways than one.

Technology has served as a great bridge to fill the gaps of
communication for people with disabilities, but developers should
continue creating new designs that not only serve the disabled
community, but the rest of the world as well. We broke out into
discussion groups to discuss Girma’s idea of reimagining design to
ensure greater accessibility. She never wants to get stuck in old
patterns, but rather, to continue moving forward with new
designs. Most to all the groups supported this idea - that providing
greater accessibility is only a positive for humanity as a whole and
that designers must challenge the norm in order to create new
innovation and design opportunities. However, there can be some
instances where the wheel should not be reinvented— instances that are
working perfectly fine and efficiently for humanity as of now. Going
forward should only include fixing the ideas that were not perfect to
begin with and making them better; however, if an idea was originally
perfect, then there is no need to spend time fixing what does not need
to be fixed.

A more current example is how changes brought on by the COVID pandemic
have (in some ways) improved accessibility and created more accessible
options such as asynchronous classes, curbside groceries, and remote
work. In small groups we then debated whether or not these options
will continue on once they are no longer needed or convenient for the
majority. The decision was unanimous with the supporting idea that the
door has now been opened to improve accessibility in ways that no one
thought was possible. People now have an option that they know works
and corporations and employees cannot hide the fact that it does not
work. This opens the door to so many more possibilities, for both
those with disabilities and those with none.

The disabled can no longer be discriminated against in the hiring
process for needing accommodations to get to and from work because the
pandemic has revealed that in many cases, working from home is a
completely viable option. With this established precedent, businesses
can no longer go back to the ways things were before. Improved
accessibility is here to stay, and if not for the entire population,
at least for people with disabilities. Furthermore, groups discussed
the scenario of working at a company in which accessibility was
excluded from the design process/ budget and what they thought should
be done. Some groups suggested getting product managers and designers
on board to request budget increases from higher ups in order to fund
the creation of more accessibility in the design. In addition, some
students suggested that there should be laws to guide people and
create a baseline for disability accommodations.

The class also covered an [article written by Sheri
Byre-Haber](https://uxdesign.cc/ethical-design-and-accessibility-a287c930a8ab),
a subject matter expert in the fields of disability and accessibility
in the business and educational settings. In her article on Ethical
design and accessibility, she argues that developers view disability
considerations as a legal requirement to fulfill, instead of
considering disabled individuals as members of a product’s user
base. She compares this to “teaching to the test”, in other words,
individuals only look at the items they are being measured to. Then,
examples of compliance versus good user experience were provided. The
first was closed captioning. As a compliant experience, closed
captioning is required; however, it is not on by default which would
create a better user experience. The second example is motion. As a
compliant experience, motion must be limited, but there is not a way
to shut off all motion associated with a login profile which would
create a better experience.

Moreover, the author argues that designing for accessibility can run
into a problem of prioritizing one marginalized group over
another. For example, spending an entire design budget on closed
captioning while ignoring described audio. Additionally, she states
that dark patterns can disproportionately affect people with
disabilities and continues this idea by exploring ways in which dark
patterns break WCAG 2.1 (Web Content Disability Guidelines). The class
was then presented with some discussion questions which uncovered the
idea that guidelines quantify how well different companies and
websites are doing with regards to accessibility. In other words,
guidelines provide a baseline for accessibility because it is
different across the spectrum for different companies and products;
similar to how a minimum wage provides a baseline for paying workers.

## Thursday 25 March

For [homework](https://github.com/csethics/csethics.github.io/discussions/30),
the lead group assigned two activities that tasked students
with using a web disability simulator and a [cookie consent
game](https://cookieconsentspeed.run/) — preparing students to start thinking about the main
topics covered in the next discussion on dark patterns and
gamification. The presenting group opened the class with a
discussion on the web disability simulator and the cookie
consent.

Discussion on the disability simulator focused around
being surprised how inaccessible the web is, and that there is
little importance placed on making the web
accessible. Students thought that the cookie consent game was
interesting as it showed how preferences can use distracting
language to get users to agree to things that they might not
want. In other words, the use of distracting language enables
users to agree to terms they were unaware of in order to have
access to the website.

Next, the lead group introduced dark patterns a term coined by Harry
Brignull, an independent user experience consultant. Dark patterns are
defined as patterns created in the user interface that trick users
into doing things such as buying overpriced insurance with their
purchase or signing up for recurring bills. There are many different
types of dark patterns such as trick questions, sneak-into-basket, and
roach motel to name a few. The lead group then reviewed the reading
[_Dark Patterns at Scale: Findings from a Crawl of 11K Shopping
Websites_](https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/dark-patterns/). The
study in the article focused on an automated approach to identifying
dark patterns on shopping websites through the use of a web crawler
and text clustering. In addition, the author’s created their own
taxonomy of identifying dark patterns.  The author’s findings revealed
that 11 percent of the websites used dark patterns and that more
popular websites were likely to feature dark patterns. The majority of
dark patterns found were “covert, deceptive, and information hiding in
nature.”

The class moved into a discussion on who was responsible for the
negative effects of dark patterns. Students felt that although dark
patterns are often a form of marketing and advertising which leaves
users responsible for themselves, responsibility also falls on
designers for manipulating and taking advantage of people’s
vulnerability and lack of technological literacy. In addition, one
group provided an interesting comparison of dark patterns to the sales
tax in the United States vs. in other countries. The sales tax in the
U.S is hidden in the initial price but charged at the end of the
transaction. This conditions people in the US to expect the final
price to be different from the advertised price, so opens the door to
lots of other additional charges.

Next, the lead group reviewed [_How to Spot--and Avoid--Dark
Patterns_](https://archive.is/4IJjk) by Eric Ravenscraft. The article
describes a variety of dark patterns and gives real world examples of
them. The reading argues that education is the most powerful tool for
prevention and that public vocal complaints are also impactful. The
class then moved on to playing a “Can you spot the dark pattern(s)?”
game. Students worked in groups to identify and determine dark
patterns in example scenarios— considering solutions and legal issues
to any dark patterns that were found.

The lead group then provided an overview of gamification, “a technique
which designers use to insert gameplay elements in non-game settings,
so they enhance user engagement with a product or service”. Examples
of gamification include challenges, points, badges, leaderboards,
journeys, and constraints. The role of gamification in UX design is
that it leverages the motivating factors of games to incentivize users
to achieve goals and overcome negative associations with the system or
required tasks. The lead group discussed “White Hat” vs. “Black Hat”
Gamification. White Hat gamification often makes users feel powerful,
fulfilled, and satisfied by providing a sense of meaning,
accomplishment, and empowerment. Black Hat gamification often makes
users feel obsessed, anxious, and addicted by providing pressures of
scarcity, unpredictability, and avoidance. Next, the lead group
discussed positive examples of gamification in UX design such as Pain
Squad and the Nike+ FuelBand.

The class then discussed the article [_A critique of Robinhood’s
gamified
interface_](https://www.georgetowninvest.com/blog/a-critique-of-robinhoods-gamified-interface). The
article provided an overview of Robinhood, a popular fintech investing
app among young adults which allows users to conveniently trade/invest
in securities directly from their smartphone app. The stated mission
of Robinhood is to “democratize finance” and simplicity of the app’s
design has been a source of praise and criticism.

The authors of the reading argue that gamified design desensitizes
users from the gravity of securities trading: “Users interact with it
more like a social media rather than stock trading app,” checking
their accounts 10x a day on average and “in the first 3 months of
2020, Robinhood users trade 40x more shares than traditional brokerage
firm Charles Schwab’s users”. Gamified elements of the app’s design
include free shares of stock for joining/recruiting friends, flashing
green and red colors, bursts of virtual confetti, badges based on your
portfolio mix, “swipe up to submit” gestures to execute trades. The
class concluded with a discussion on the ethics behind Robinhood’s use
of gamification and the instances of user harm from the app’s
interface, such as the 20-year-old college student who took his own
life because of an error in the application.
