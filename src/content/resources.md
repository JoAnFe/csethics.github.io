## Other Classes

This sheet, collected by [Casey
Fisler](https://cfiesler.medium.com/tech-ethics-curricula-a-collection-of-syllabi-3eedfb76be18)
summarize courses on tech ethics: [Tech Ethics
Curriculum](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jWIrA8jHz5fYAW4h9CkUD8gKS5V98PDJDymRf8d9vKI/edit#gid=0). Her
SIGSCE 2020 paper, [_What Do We Teach When We Teach Tech Ethics? A
Syllabi
Analysis_](https://cmci.colorado.edu/~cafi5706/SIGCSE2020_EthicsSyllabi.pdf)
provides an analysis of these courses.
