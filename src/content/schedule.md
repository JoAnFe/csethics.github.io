The schedule details will be filled in as the semester progresses (and
future weeks are subject to change, but as much as is known is
documented here).

# Week 1: Introduction

### Tuesday, 2 February

**Reading assignment:** Ian Barbour, [_Ethics in an Age of Technology_](/docs/barbour-views-of-technology.pdf)

This is from a 1993 book based on a series of lectures Barbour gave in
1989. Barbour considers three different views of technology: (1)
Technology as Liberator, (2) Technology as Threat, and (3) Technology
as Instrument of Power.

Before **Wednesday at 6:59pm**, post a response in the [Discussion
Site](https://github.com/csethics/csethics.github.io/discussions/7#discussion-2560242)
(see details there on what your response should be). (Note that it
will get harder to post a satisfactory response as more students have
posted, so it is advantageous to do this earlier and have more
opportunities for discussion.)

You will need to acquire Ruha Benjamin's book, [_Race After
Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim
Code_](https://www.ruhabenjamin.com/race-after-technology) which will
be the main reading for Weeks 2, 3, and 4. Here are some possible
buying options:
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Race-After-Technology-Abolitionist-Tools/dp/1509526404),
[Barnes &amp;
Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/race-after-technology-ruha-benjamin/1130411395),
[Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/books/race-after-technology-abolitionist-tools-for-the-new-jim-code/9781509526406).
