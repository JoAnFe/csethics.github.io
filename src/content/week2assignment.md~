**Response assignments for Team 2 and Team 4:**

- By **10:59pm** on **Sunday, 7 February**, post a response to the
  _Race After Technology_ (RAT) reading and John McWhorter essay that
  does at least _one_ of these options:

1. Ruha Benjamin and John McWhorter espouse different views on whether
technology can be "racist" and these differences would inform
different types of solutions. Summarize the essence of the difference
(if no post has already done this well) and explain which view you
find more convincing and why.

2. Respond to something in one of the readings that you found
interesting or surprising.


3. Identify something in one of the readings that you disagree with,
and explain why.

4. Respond constructively to something someone else posted.

**Response assignments for Team 3 and Team 5:**

- By **5:59pm** on **Monday, 8 February**, post a response to the
  readings that either (1) responds constructively to one of the
  initial postings, or (2) does any of the options above, but without
  duplicating points that were already made.
