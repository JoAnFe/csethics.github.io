<p>Lead: <strong>Team 4</strong><br>
Blog: <strong>Team 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Plan for Week 12: Mock Trial</strong></p>
<p>This week will be a bit different from previous weeks. Most of Tuesday will be a discussion on the readings and topic similar to what we have done previous weeks, but on Thursday, we are going to mix things up a bit and conduct a mock trial!</p>
<p>We are going to split up into teams (we will be splitting the class into teams by the end of class Tuesday) and have teams debate and defend their assigned positions on Thursday. Your side will either be arguing for an anti-trust remedy that splits up big tech companies, or arguing against such a remedy. Your position should be based on the readings and any supplemental materials you find. In addition to the required readings, you are able to use materials from the Google case as
supporting evidence for your argument. Once assigned a side, you can choose to read the relevant optional reading to develop your argument. We will go over the plan in more detail in class Tuesday, but wanted to give you some idea of what is planned now, and hope that you will do the assigned readings and discussion thinking about how you would make a case supporting or countering the &ldquo;break up big tech&rdquo; position. We hope everyone is excited and ready to debate!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/csethics/csethics.github.io/discussions/37">Week 12 Discussion</a></p>
<h2 id="blog-summary">Blog Summary</h2>
<p><strong>Team 2</strong></p>
<p>20/22 April<br>
Lead: Team 4; Blog: Team 2</p>
<h2 id="tuesday-20-april">Tuesday, 20 April</h2>
<p>The topic of this week’s discussion was centered around Big Tech
and antitrust. To start off, we took a survey asking our opinions on
the debate on breaking up Big Tech. The following three questions were
asked:</p>
<ol>
<li>Based on the readings/videos, which side
do you agree with more?
<li> Which search engine do you use?
<li>What did you find most interesting in the readings/videos?
</ol>
<p>The results of the survey indicate 75% of the class think that
breaking up Big Tech is not the solution, and 25% think that breaking
up Big Tech is the solution. When asked about which search engine we
use, the overwhelming majority of us use Google (85.7%) and 14.3% use
DuckDuckGo. No one from our class uses Bing or Yahoo. In response to
what people found the most interesting from the reading, many of us
noted the dominance of companies like Google, how long this issue has
been developing, and how long these debates and congressional hearings
will continue to develop.</p>
<p>We then went into a discussion of our required readings. The speaker
started with an overview and history of Antitrust. This included the
Sherman Antitrust Act which was the first Federal act that outlawed
monopolistic business practices. This act was designed to restore
competition and protect consumers, and is a basis for the debate of
the dominance of Big Tech.</p>
<p>The speaker detailed the United States vs. Google case, which is still
under review. The main argument states Google is a monopolist in
general search services, search advertising, and search text
advertising. Google uses</span><span class="c3"> a web of
interlocking contracts, preset default status on browsers, voice
assistants, and other contracts that limit competition. It owns 80% of
the general search queries 2019 and up to 88% in 2019.</p>
<p>Then, the team summarized the July 31 2020 hearing of the Facebook,
Google, Amazon, and Apple CEOs. The claims against Big Tech included
they reduce privacy, choices, and impede the innovation of other
designers. They have more accurate algorithms because they have more
data from the consumers. Additionally, CEOs justified collecting data
from users by claiming it improves user experience.</p>
<p>The team summarized the reading “How Stronger
Antitrust Rules Could Help Consumers”. The key components of
this reading include how experts say bipartisan efforts could increase
competition in the tech industry and could improve products and
services. The author uses examples of Big Tech’s dominating
practices, such as Amazon selling Amazon-brand products, Apple booting
Fortnite from the App Store, and how Google takes a cut from ads. In
response, Senator Amy Klobucher of Minnesota proposed The Competition
and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act of 2021, which would
significantly toughen federal antitrust laws in a way that could
encourage competition in the tech industry. Additionally, this article
advocates for more money for enforcement of antitrust, including
increasing budget, increasing FTC and DOJ employees, and establishing
a new division at the FTC charged with researching the impacts of
mergers on markets.</p>
<p>After summarizing these readings, we discussed the following questions
centered around breaking up Big Tech in breakout rooms:</p>
<ol>
<li> Should the Sherman Antitrust Act still
be in place today?
<li>What are some of Google&rsquo;s key features that have
identified the company as a monopolist?
<li>What are the arguments for breaking up
Big Tech?
</ol>
<p>In response to the first question, one group argued the Sherman
Antitrust Act is lacking. They think that further regulation or
separate regulation would help it to be more effective for the present
day.</p>
<p>In discussing the second question regarding Google as a monopolist,
one group noted the social effects that have contributed to
Google’s dominance. For example, instead of saying
“I’m searching something,” we tend to say
“I’m Googling something.” Additionally, the
differences between Google and search engines such as DuckDuckGo were
compared. For instance, Google search results are much more
personalized than other search engine results. Another comment on the
second question is that while these companies are not complete
monopolies, the growth of the companies are extremely threatening. The
features, the environment, the culture, data collection all contribute
to Google’s potential to dominate. While it may not be possible
to completely take out all of the competing search engines, 92% as of
2021 is a scary number.</p>
<p>In response to the third question, one person noted how these
companies are using monopolistic business practices, as the Sherman
Act defines, which is a reason in favor of breaking up these tech
giants.</p>
<p>The team summarized the Harvard Business Review article,
“Antitrust Isn’t the Solution to America’s Biggest
Tech Problem.” The key points of this article include that
antitrust action would be long and drawn-out and instead, we should
focus on the bigger problem, which is getting reliable internet access
for more Americans. The last point the team points out is that while
some may disagree with making a deal with tech giants, it would be a
practice step forward.</p>
<p>Finally, the team summarized Google’s response to the
lawsuit. Google claims that the biggest flaw is that people choose to
use Google because they choose to, not because they are forced
to. People can easily download their choice of apps or change their
default settings from Google to another search engine. The response
also touches on how people access information in lots of different
ways, for example, people receive news from Twitter and can find
restaurants on OpenTable.</p>
<p>After summarizing these readings, we discussed the
following questions centered around arguments against breaking up Big
Tech:</p>
<ol>
<li> What are the arguments against breaking up Big Tech?
<li> Do you think antitrust is as problematic as other issues?
<li> Instead of breaking up tech giants, should regulators use
them, their influence, and technological prowess to solve other
problems?
</ol>
<p>Responses varied for these questions. For example, one group talked
about how some people don’t have access to the Internet, so the
break up of these companies would not affect them as much. This
reinforces the class system in America, so there becomes the question
of if regulators and lawmakers should shift their focus to other
issues.</p>
<p>To end Tuesday’s discussion, students were assigned to one of
two teams for Thursday’s mock trial: Team 1) In favor of
breaking up Big Tech or Team 2) Against breaking up Big Tech. The
remaining three students were on the jury.</p>
<h2 id="thursday-22-april">Thursday, 22 April</h2>
<p>The lead team began the class by giving an overview of the arguments
found within this week’s optional readings: <em>Crime
Shouldn’t Pay: Why Big Tech Executives Should Face Jail</em> by
Matt Stoller, and <em>Don’t Break Up Big Tech</em> by Zachary
Karabell. The former makes the argument for breaking up Big Tech,
while the latter makes the argument against it.</p>
<p>In his article in favor of breaking up Big Tech, Stoller brings up
antitrust lawsuits against Facebook and Google, among others. These
suits include allegations that Google and Facebook monopolized the
online ad market and that Google has been “manipulating its
search results to disfavor specialized competitors” and
“blocking competitors who seek to enter new search
markets.” Google and Facebook are also accused of being in a
cartel “to violate user privacy and fix prices in advertising
markets,” which is prohibited under the Sherman Antitrust Act
and easier to prosecute than monopolization allegations. The article
argues that Big Tech is causing significant societal harm through
monopolies and they must be subject to criminal
enforcement.</p>
<p>Karabell’s article, on the other hand, argues mainly that the
reasons behind wanting to break up Big Tech are valid but that
breaking up such companies is not an effective solution to the
underlying issues. For example, Karabell brings up past antitrust
lawsuits that resulted in the mandated breakup of big monopolists like
AT&amp;T and Standard Oil; in these cases, the companies eventually
reconsolidated and actually helped to make shareholders wealthier
while still dominating the market. The lead team also brought up
Karabell’s point that while breaking up Big Tech may allow for a
more competitive field of industry players, competition itself does
not guarantee the desired outcomes for consumers, such as better
services and lower prices.</p>
<p>After the overview, the class split into two teams to begin the mock
trial. The subject of the mock trial was related to the topic of Big
Tech, and whether or not Big Tech companies should be broken up to
address anti-trust issues, or whether Big Tech companies should be
allowed to remain in-tact, as they are. Team 1 was assigned to defend
the side of breaking up Big Tech companies, while Team 2 had to defend
Big Tech companies and allow them to remain in-tact.</p>
<p>The class transitioned into a brief brainstorming session before
beginning opening arguments. Team 1 began their opening arguments by
stating that Big Tech companies have been participating in a
combination of market share and anti-competitive practices that have
allowed them to thrive and grow at rates that threaten competition
within the industry. As an example, Team 1 referred to Google’s
current 92% market share in search engines. Team 2 began their opening
arguments by stating that historically, breaking up large companies
has not provided a solution to increasing competition within an
industry. Team 2 continued by stating that breaking up these companies
does not lessen the advantage they have in terms of resources or
overall popularity among consumers. Once opening arguments concluded,
teams broke out into another brainstorming session before beginning
questioning.</p>
<p>Below is a brief summary of some of the questions and answers that
were given during each team’s allotted time for
questioning.</p>
<h3 id="team-1rsquos-questions-for-team-2">Team 1’s Questions for Team 2</h3>
<p>Q: <em>Can you describe these tech companies’ business plans?</em><br>
A: Provide an easy-to-use platform for consumers, which
improves with increasing numbers of users.</p>
<p>Q: <em>What is the priority in the US economy, consumer choice or
business profits?</em>
A: Consumer choice, as this would increase market competition and lower prices for
services.</p>
<p>Q: <em>What does our current economy look like?</em>
A: Capitalistic.</p>
<p>Q: <em>So you agree the free market is necessary in our economy and that
free markets are attributed to having less regulation?</em>
A: Yes</p>
<p>Q: <em>Which will lead to less regulation, breaking up Big Tech or increasing
regulations?</em>
Q: A: Both are forms of regulation; breaking up Big Tech is regulatory in itself.</p>
<p>Q: <em>Yes, but breaking up Big Tech only involves regulation initially. Regulation will not be needed after the companies are broken up.</em>
A: A lack of regulation after breaking up Big Tech allows for these companies to reconsolidate and creates a cyclical problem that would need to be repeatedly
“fixed” by imposing regulations one way or another. This
is not the most effective way to solve the underlying
issues.</p>
<p>Q: <em>Considering that these companies are prohibiting smaller companies from being competitive (Amazon, for example), why do you think breaking them up would not
help?</em>
A: Because breaking up monopolist companies in the past has proved ineffective in the long run; even broken up, these companies retain great power and eventually just
reconsolidate.</p>
<h3 id="team-2rsquos-questions-for-team-1">Team 2’s Questions for Team 1</h3>
<p>Q: <em>What would keep these companies from reconsolidating, considering you mentioned that you
would not impose regulations after initially breaking them
up?</em>
A: Having written
guidelines/laws would prevent companies from becoming large, but if
they do get back together it is inevitable. Hopefully enforcing
stricter rules will deter them from doing so.</p>
<p>Q: <em>Many small companies use these platforms as brokers for their own
products (for marketing, advertising, and the actual selling in the
case of Amazon). If big tech is broken up, might that inhibit smaller
companies’ ability to use these platforms as effectively as
before?</em>
A: No, you are only dividing the workforce
so it would not hinder the quality of work. For example, different
departments within a company would be broken up into separate
companies.</p>
<p>Q: <em>If a well-known company were to break up,
do you think consumers would still prefer something they are familiar
with or another less well-known alternative?</em>
A: They probably will prefer something they are familiar
with, but overtime customers preferences can change. For example,
TikTok was not a thing a few years ago, but now it is very
popular.</p>
<p>Q: <em>If big tech were to
break up, how would this guarantee the desired outcomes (such as
better services, lower prices, etc.)? For example, the Wired article
argues that “perhaps there would be
openings for companies with different business models, ones that brand
themselves as valuing privacy and empowering individual ownership of
data,” but that “the nature of data selling and data
mining is so embedded in the current models of most IT companies that
it is very hard to see how such businesses could thrive unless they
charged more to consumers than consumers have so far been willing to
pay.”. How will breaking
up these companies protect the smaller companies or protect
users’ data privacy better?</em><br>
A: A single company does not have access to most people’s data compared to a
bigger company.</p>
<p>Q: <em>There have been many instances in history
where monopolies have been broken up, many of these are ineffective,
what would make this any different?</em></p>
<p>After questioning, Team 1 headed directly into their closing
arguments. Below are transcriptions of each team’s
arguments:</p>
<p><strong>Team 1’s Closing Arguments</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big Tech companies have been able to grow in size and generate profits beyond
their competitors by establishing a reckless feedback loop on top of
their market dominance. In Google’s case, they used their search
engine to establish dominance. This enabled them to generate enough
profits to acquire companies such as YouTube in order to expand into
the video industry. Then they dominated mobile with Android, bundling
Android phones with the g suite apps, requiring the installation of
Google’s apps into all android phones. They reaped the profits
with Apple by allowing Apple products to use Google as their default
search engine.</p>
<p>Facebook used their social network market
dominance to increase their size by acquiring their rivals, such as
Instagram and WhatsApp. profit by buying all their rivals. They even
tried buying snapchat after replicating many snapchat features, but
ultimately were turned down by the smaller social media
app.</p>
<p>Amazon uses their dominant marketplace to
collect data on products that they deem to be successful and then
develop their own version of the products, undercutting competitors in
order to maximize sales and profits.</p>
<p>Apple’s App
Store is the only way to provide apps to iOS devices. They defend this
decision by arguing that the App Store is what makes iOS arguably the
most secure operating system. But Apple has complete control over who
is allowed access to the market, which gives actual control over their
competition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Team 2’s Closing Arguments</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a data-driven economy, the process of monopolization is inevitable and
enforcing laws seems cyclical. The majority of digital platforms are
natural monopolies, meaning they result from high barriers of entry to
the market. Breaking these Big Tech companies up would eliminate their
fundamental advantage.</p>
<p>Although in the past
antitrust regulation has had an effect, it is not the one desired by
the public as seen in both AT&amp;T and Standard Oil’s Antitrust
cases, in which the industry later reconsolidated. The idea of having
less regulation after these companies are broken up in order to
maintain this capitalist free economy is good in theory, however
without regulation as seen through precedent these companies will
likely reconsolidate.</p>
<p>Breaking up Big
Tech companies is not necessarily a solution to the key issues the
solution is meant to address&ndash;more competition and data privacy. In
regards to competition, many users prefer to use Big Tech platforms,
they are not forced to use them as other alternatives still exist that
are visible on pages (Safari displays Yahoo and Bing search) and
settings can be easily changed (e.g. Apple’s search engine can
be defaulted to Bing instead of Google).</p>
<p>Overall, we feel
that a different solution is necessary rather than simply
‘breaking up’ Big Tech to better address these issues of
data privacy, competition, and innovation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After deliberating for a few minutes, the jury took the stage with
their decision. The jury found that Team 2’s arguments were more
compelling and ruled in favor of not breaking up Big Tech
companies.</p>
