      <description>A draft syllabus is now posted: Syllabus. This will give more of an idea what is planned for the class, but is incomplete and likely to change before the class starts.
The Discussion forum is now open!
The semester hasn&amp;rsquo;t started, students in this class will be interested in this seminar on Monday at 4pm: Timnit Gebru: Computer Vision - Who is helped and who is harmed? Dr. Gebru has been much in the news recently, and I expect this talk will be relevant to topics we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss in the first few weeks of the class.</description>

      <description>This is a draft preview of the course syllabus. It is subject to change until the class begins on February 2.Overview Course Description:
Most decisions today are made by software, most of the rules of society are interpreted and enforced by programs, and much human interaction is now mediated by computing platforms that decide what people see and who they can talk to. As the people who decide what software gets written and how it is deployed, computer scientists have disproportionate power to mold society — for both good and bad.</description>

      <description>If you are interested in joining the class, please submit this form:
 https://forms.gle/xZECFhH7DNYHyc6X9  (or send me an email on ethical reasons why we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t ask students to submit information like this using a google form).
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the course will be over-subscribed, but if the course fills up, I will be able to add a small number of additional students to the course who I will select based on these responses.</description>
