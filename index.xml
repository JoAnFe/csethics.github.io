      <description>If you are interested in joining the class, please submit this form:
 https://forms.gle/xZECFhH7DNYHyc6X9  (or send me an email on ethical reasons why we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t ask students to submit information like this using a google form).
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the course will be over-subscribed, but if the course fills up, I will be able to add a small number of additional students to the course who I will select based on these responses.</description>
